My first python project : Creating a snake game

References : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-snake-game-using-turtle-in-python/

Target Function : 
1. Customize map size 
2. Game difficulty 
3. Pop a " would you like to hang out with me? " message when player get to specific score (Idea suggested by : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xf1TMs0ysk)

Bug Found :
1. If snake eat its own body, the next game remain its own body when start
2. Sometime the food become invisible / outside the map
